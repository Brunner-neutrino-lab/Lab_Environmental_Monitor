# Lab_Environmental_Monitor
The goal of the project is to record environmental variables continuously over years with the use of various sensors such as a particulate counter or pressure differential sensor, to then upload the data to a server using a Raspberry Pi. Using various python submodules specific to each sensor, properties such as temperature, pressure differential, humidity, and dust levels are monitored and uploaded to a database at periodic time intervals. This would allow the user to verify whether the lab has a positive pressure differential relative to the outside to keep the dust out and to correlate when and how the dust particles enter. A 3d-printed case has been designed to package all these components together.
